# 🏀 JavaScript Scoreboard Project

This project was built as part of the **JavaScript course** in Scrimba (https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v). It’s a simple basketball-style scoreboard that uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** to demonstrate DOM manipulation and user interaction.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice updating the DOM dynamically with JavaScript
- Understand how to use functions and event listeners
- Work with global variables and real-time UI updates
- Use custom fonts and animations for styling
- Apply layout techniques using Flexbox

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — page structure
- **CSS3** — styling and animations
- **JavaScript** — core logic and interactivity

## ✨ Features

- Add 1, 2, or 3 points to HOME or GUEST team
- Reset button to clear both scores
- Real-time score updates
